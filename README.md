Weather is something everybody deals with, and accurate data of it like what is coming can help users to make inform decisions.
Weather applications continuously update their forecasts, whether it is by the day, hour or minute, so it always takes us one step ahead. The best weather apps for Android are like pocket weather channels, and they do not just tell anyone when the sun is going to shine and the rain is going to fall, these apps tell us the wind speed, the UV level, humidity levels, and even “feels like” temperature to account for the dreaded wind chill.
